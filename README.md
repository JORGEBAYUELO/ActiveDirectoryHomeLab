# üìÇ Windows Active Directory Home Lab Setup

This repository contains detailed instructions for setting up a **Windows Active Directory Home Lab** using VMware Workstation. The lab includes a primary domain controller, a secondary domain controller for failover scenarios, and two client machines. Additionally, we set up **osTicket**, a web-based ticketing system, integrated into the Active Directory environment.

## Overview of The Active Directory Home Lab

This home lab simulates a real-world **Windows Active Directory environment** using **VMware** **Workstation**. It consists of **two Windows Server VMs** (a **primary domain controller** and a backup for **failover scenarios**) plus **two client machines**. Through this setup, I gained hands-on experience with **Active Directory management,** **Group Policy configurations,** **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),** **user role management,** **and troubleshooting scenarios**.

The lab also features **osTicket,** an **open-source** **ticketing system,** which simulates **IT support and Help Desk workflows** while incorporating **PHP, MySQL, and IIS web server configurations.**

This environment provided valuable practical experience in **user support, ticketing management, software troubleshooting, and database administration.**

## Requirements:

To complete this lab setup, the following software and tools are required:

- **VMware Workstation** For creating virtual machines (You could also use VirtualBox)
- **Windows Server 2022** For Domain Controllers and Failover setup
- **Windows 11** For client machines
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** Role for the domain controller
- **PHP 8.2**, **MySQL**, and **osTicket** For the ticketing system

## VMware Setup:

### 1. Prepare VMware Workstation
- **Objective**: Set up VMware Workstation and create the VMs for primary server, secondary server (failover), and two client machines.
1. Open VMware Workstation
2. Verify that bridged networking is enabled. This ensures all VMs can communicate with each other and your host machine.
   - Go to Edit > Virtual Network Editor
   - Select the network adapter you want to use for bridged networking (by default vmnet0) and ensure it‚Äôs connected to the correct physical network.

### 2. Create the Virtual Machines
We‚Äôll now create four virtual machines:

## Simulating Failover Scenarios:
**Objective:**
Understand what happens when a domain controller goes offline and how client machines behave, particularly with cached credentials and resource availability.
### 1. Setting up an Additional Domain Controller
This involves promoting another server in the lab as a secondary (replica) domain controller.
1. Open VMware Workstation and create a new virtual machine:
  - Follow the same process we did for ADLab-DC1 to set up the first domain controller, but name it something like ADLab-DC2.
  - Assign 4GB of RAM and at least 60GB of storage.
2. Install Windows Server:
  - Install the same version of Windows Server as the primary domain controller.
  - Set the computer name to ADLab-DC2.
3. Configure Networking:
  - Assign a static IP address:
    - Go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change Adapter Settings.
