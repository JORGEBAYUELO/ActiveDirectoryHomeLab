# Windows Active Directory Home Lab Setup

This repository contains detailed instructions for setting up a **Windows Active Directory Home Lab** using VMware Workstation. The lab includes a primary domain controller, a secondary domain controller for failover scenarios, and two client machines. Additionally, we set up **osTicket**, a web-based ticketing system, integrated into the Active Directory environment.

## Overview of The Active Directory Home Lab

This home lab simulates a real-world **Windows Active Directory environment** using **VMware** **Workstation**. It consists of **two Windows Server VMs** (a **primary domain controller** and a backup for **failover scenarios**) plus **two client machines**. Through this setup, I gained hands-on experience with **Active Directory management,** **Group Policy configurations,** **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),** **user role management,** **and troubleshooting scenarios**.

The lab also features **osTicket,** an **open-source** **ticketing system,** which simulates **IT support and Help Desk workflows** while incorporating **PHP, MySQL, and IIS web server configurations.**

This environment provided valuable practical experience in **user support, ticketing management, software troubleshooting, and database administration.**

## You'll need the following:

To complete this lab setup, the following software and tools are required:

- **VMware Workstation** For creating virtual machines (You could also use VirtualBox)
- **Windows Server 2022** For Domain Controllers and Failover setup
- **Windows 11** For client machines
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** Role for the domain controller
- **PHP 8.2**, **MySQL**, and **osTicket** For the ticketing system

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Prepare VMware Workstation
- **Objective**: Set up VMware Workstation and create the VMs for primary server, secondary server (failover), and two client machines.
1. Open VMware Workstation
2. Verify that bridged networking is enabled. This ensures all VMs can communicate with each other and your host machine.
   - Go to Edit > Virtual Network Editor
   - Select the network adapter you want to use for bridged networking (by default vmnet0) and ensure it’s connected to the correct physical network.

### 2. Create the Virtual Machines
We’ll now create four virtual machines:
1. Windows Server (Domain Controller)
2. Windows Server (Failover Setup)
3. Client Machine 1
4. Client Machine 2

### 3. Create the First Virtual Machine (Windows Server)
1. Open VMware Workstation and click on File > New Virtual Machine.
2. Select Custom (advanced) and click Next.

7. Assign the VM:
   - 4 GB RAM
   - 2 Processors with 2 cores per processor

### 4. Install Windows Server
- **Objective**: Set up the **Secondary Server VM** to handle failovers.
- **Action**: 
   - Install **AD DS** on the Secondary Server VM and configure it as a **Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)**.
   - Set up replication between the Primary and Secondary Domain Controllers.
   - Simulate failover scenarios to ensure backup functionality.

### 5. Configuring Client Machines
- **Objective**: Add two client VMs to the domain.
- **Action**: 
   - Join **two Windows 10 client VMs** to the `lab.local` domain.
   - Test user login and domain communication.

### 6. Group Policy Configuration
- **Objective**: Implement **Group Policies** to manage client machines.
- **Action**: 
   - Create Organizational Units (OUs) for users and groups.
   - Implement **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** to enforce domain policies like password complexity and user restrictions.

### 7. Simulating Failover Scenarios
- **Objective**: Test the failover setup between the primary and secondary domain controllers.
- **Action**: 
   - Simulate a server failure on the Primary Domain Controller.
   - Verify that the Secondary Domain Controller takes over successfully and that Active Directory replication is intact.

### 8. Installing osTicket (Ticketing System)

- **Objective**: Test the functionality of **osTicket** in a domain-joined environment.
- **Action**: 
   - Submit test tickets via **osTicket** (e.g., password reset request).
   - Resolve tickets by performing corresponding actions in **Active Directory**.
   - Test the entire workflow to ensure smooth integration with the domain environment.

### 10. Final Validation and Verification
